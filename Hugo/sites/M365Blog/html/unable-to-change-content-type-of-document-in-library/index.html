        <p>I was trying to remove a content type from a document library which was associated with multiple content types.

The solution that worked for me was to open the document in desktop office and open the &ldquo;Advanced Properties&rdquo;. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/advancedproperties.png" alt="advancedproperties"> Find and select the property ContentTypeId and click on Delete. <strong><img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/contenttypeiddelete.png" alt="contenttypeiddelete"></strong> After deleting the ContentTypeId property I was able to update the content type property of the document and eventually remove the old content type from the document library.</p>
