        <p>Recently while trying to deploy a CRM package into system test  environment using the import-crmpackage command via PowerShell, time-out was occurring despite doubling the RAM memory as well as removing a lot of checkpoints from the machine. On the DEV environment, the deployment was taking around 20 mins. The DEV machine has more resources allocated explaining why the time-out was not spotted. To resolve the timeout issue, the lengthy instructions from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/918609">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article</a> can be followed. A simpler solution would be to set the timeout property during import. From the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn756301.aspx">Import-CrmPackage documentation</a> the -timeout property is of type string and meant for internal purpose only. The format of data the -timeout property is not evident. We tried passing &ldquo;3600&rdquo; which would be 1 hour if the property was expecting seconds, however the import-crmpackage failed because of invalid data. <code>Import-CrmPackage -CrmConnection $CRMConn -PackageDirectory &quot;$($filePath)&quot; -PackageName CRMPackageDeploymentTest.dll -Verbose -Timeout &quot;3600&quot;; Import-</code> Using a .Net Reflector tool, we managed to find out the format the timeout property needs to be passed is a timespan object of format &ldquo;g&rdquo;. By default the timeout is set to 30 mins. <code>Import-CrmPackage -CrmConnection $CRMConn -PackageDirectory &quot;$($filePath)&quot; -PackageName CRMPackageDeploymentTest.dll -Verbose -Timeout &quot;1:00:00&quot;;</code> The deployment process took 34 mins to finish and timeout error was not thrown.</p>
