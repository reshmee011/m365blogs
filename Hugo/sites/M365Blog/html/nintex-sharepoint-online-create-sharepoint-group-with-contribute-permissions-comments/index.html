Hello Reshmee, Great tutorial! I could confirm that the content type has to be text/xml (as described above). But when I try to create the Group. I got the following error message: &ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource&rdquo;
Hi, has anyone found a solution to this Access denied error?">

<p>Hi, has anyone found a solution to this Access denied error? thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;ve done both the workflow app permissions feature and also the app permissions to full control as above but i&rsquo;m getting &ldquo;Unauthorized&rdquo; being returned from the Create Group HTTP call? Any ideas?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>@Dub: Does the user you used to get the request digest info has access to create groups ?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It looks as if the result is returned in JSON format. Can you please try to change the content type to text/xml when making request to /_api/ContextInfo and see if it works?</p>

<p>Hi Jeroen Thanks for the comment. The permissions of the workflow app need to be configured. I have described it at the beginning of another post <a href="https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service/">https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service/</a> In summary, workflow needs to be enabled to use app permissions and be given full control from appinv.aspx page. Follow the instructions from msdn link below. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj822159(v=office.15).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj822159(v=office.15).aspx</a></p>

<p>Hello I am following your steps but in the step 2 ◾Add “Query XML” action I get the following error: XML content is invalid. 6/28/2016 6:55 AM Comment {&ldquo;d&rdquo;:{&ldquo;GetContextWebInformation&rdquo;:{&quot;__metadata&quot;:{&ldquo;type&rdquo;:&ldquo;SP.ContextWebInformation&rdquo;},&ldquo;FormDigestTimeoutSeconds&rdquo;:1800,&ldquo;FormDigestValue&rdquo;:&ldquo;0xF62EFE5E7 6/28/2016 6:56 AM Comment XML content is invalid. Data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 1..</p>

<p>Same issue for me, receive the message &ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource.&rdquo; on the create group HTTP call. All actions and the workflow itself are running with site collection admin credentials. Stuck on next steps&hellip;&hellip;great tutorial thus far though!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The effective permissions of the workflow are an intersection of user permissions and the app permissions similar to SharePoint apps. If the user running the workflow does not have permissions to create group then access denied error will be thrown.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hi, the user is set up as site collection admin. Also, the workflow actions are running within app step with elevated privileges.</p>
