Hi there, can you provide some advice here. When I copy-paste your code in the Script Editor, I don&rsquo;t get buttons but Text fields instead. The javascript code also doesn&rsquo;t work for me. Any troubleshooting ideas?
Hi Lilia Thanks very much for trying my code. The single and double quotes got messed up. I have replaced the code with a link to github https://gist.">

<p>Hi Lilia Thanks very much for trying my code. The single and double quotes got messed up. I have replaced the code with a link to github <a href="https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/b36395eb08654baa4a8e6e3c9f83e6f4">https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/b36395eb08654baa4a8e6e3c9f83e6f4</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This code is great have been looking for something like this for a while. I am now using the selected items part and need to export to excel or csv. Any ideas on that. I have looked through the web nothing really being done in java script. All trusted solutions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How would you update a drop-down field? – In my work area needing to route these items to 3 levels (review, validate and then approve) &mdash;when selecting the approve button how can this Javascript change my drop-down field? (steps please –new with Java&hellip;.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is exactly the solution I am looking for however, it is not posting back to the SharePoint Online list. Is there something different that needs to happen?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wow. great work :)</p>
