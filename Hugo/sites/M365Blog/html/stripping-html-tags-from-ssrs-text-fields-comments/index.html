Appreciate the code. One question; Why is this required? Dim objRegExp AS NEW System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex( “”) and RETURN objRegExp.Replace(sInput, “”) Wouldn’t a simple return of sInput suffice? What am I missing here? Been racking my brain for hours. Thanks!
Hi TimK The HTML text I had to work with had encoded characters , for example &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;. The regex expression will remove all HTML tags but for my requirements, I wanted to preserve line breaks () , so I am handling these tags individually to be replaced with line feed (chr(10)).">

<p>Hi TimK The HTML text I had to work with had encoded characters , for example &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;. The regex expression will remove all HTML tags but for my requirements, I wanted to preserve line breaks () , so I am handling these tags individually to be replaced with line feed (chr(10)). Also had to transform to bulleted string , in the example above I am replacing &quot;&quot; with &ldquo;-&rdquo;. Depending on your requirements, thus you might have to amend the code further. Thanks Reshmee</p>

<p>Hi, I tried to use your function and I get an error &quot; String constants must end with a double quote&quot;. thanks. Using Visual Studio 2013 for report design.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying the code. Unfortunately the original code which has encoded characters got converted into plain text. I have updated the post with a link to gist. Can you please try the code again?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How can I use your expression along with truncating the text to 150 characters</p>

<p>Howdy, i read your blog from time to time and i own a similar one and i was just wondering if you get a lot of spam comments? If so how do you stop it, any plugin or anything you can recommend? I get so much lately it&rsquo;s driving me insane so any support is very much appreciated.</p>
