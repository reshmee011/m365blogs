        <p>It is not possible for M365 to change the permissions of members from Edit to Contribute to prevent deletion or uncontrolled creation of lists and libraries. The option to &ldquo;Edit User Permissions&rdquo; is greyed out.</p>
<p><a href="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/image.png"><img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/image.png?w=577" alt=""></a></p>
<p>One option would be to create a custom SharePoint Group for contributors but anyone added to the custom SharePoint Group would not be part of the M365 group which means they won&rsquo;t be able to contribute via Teams or any other M365 services.</p>
<p>One undocumented approach is to rename the Edit role to &ldquo;Edit without manage lists&rdquo; and amend the permissions to remove the ability to create or delete lists and libraries.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Permissions Levels from the classic advanced permissions page</li>
<li>Click on Edit Permission</li>
<li>Update the Name to &ldquo;Edit without manage lists&rdquo; and uncheck &ldquo;Manage Lists&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>All users in the members group will be granted &ldquo;Edit without manage lists&rdquo; permissions.</p>
<p>In a non m365 connected team site Members can easily be changed to contributors as per the blog post <a href="https://capacreative.co.uk/2018/09/17/prevent-document-library-deletion/">Prevent document library deletion | CaPa Creative Ltd</a></p>
