        <p>I have set up custom duplicate rule detection on some entities&rsquo; fields on a DEV CRM 2015 instance. I needed to export the settings to be able to import into other environments. I used the link <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arpita/2014/10/15/export-duplicate-detection-rules-from-one-organization-and-import-to-another-organization-in-crm-2013/">Export Duplicate Detection Rules from one organization and import to another organization in CRM 2013</a> to export the rules. However the CRMDataMigrationUtility.exe SDK tool exports only unpublished duplicate detection rules which I had to do to be able to export the settings. This means the detection rule has to be published afterwards. Instead of doing it manually, I have written a PowerShell script which can publish a specific rule or all rules for an entity. The code is below. <a href="https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/737dfc6bfd15568098c2f71588bc7a2a">https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/737dfc6bfd15568098c2f71588bc7a2a</a> After running the script the following message is displayed. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/duplicaterulesetresult.png" alt="DuplicateRuleSetResult"></p>
