<p>I have worked with SSRS for nearly five years now. It is an efficient tool to display data from Project Server Reporting database. This article provides a step to step guide how to create reports using Report Builder from Project Server 2010 /2013 (On Premises) environment.</p>
<h2 id="2-report-builder">2. Report Builder</h2>
<p>Report Builder is a report authoring tool that helps to design, test, print and manage reports. Different type of reports can be created using a combination of tables, matrices, lists, and charts depending on reporting needs. Additionally data can be manipulated by filtering, grouping, sorting and adding expressions and parameters. After designing the report, it can be either saved to the local computer or published to report server.</p>
<h2 id="21-data-source">2.1 Data Source</h2>
<p>A data source allows connecting to a repository of data. It contains connection details and credentials. Data can be read from different sources for example: • SharePoint Lists • XML • Oracle • SQL Server 2.1.1 Create Shared Data Source The shared data source has to be created using Report Manager. 1. Open a web browser, type the URL of the reporting server in the address bar. By default, the URL is http://servername/reports If you are using SSRS integrated mode in SharePoint, configure a document library to have the following content types</p>
<ul>
<li>  Report Data Source</li>
<li>  Report Builder Model</li>
<li>  Report Builder Report</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever in the article it specifies navigate to the reporting server URL from the browser type in the URL of the reporting library. 2. Click ‘New Data Source’ if using native reporting server is used else click on &ldquo;New Document&rdquo;&gt;&ldquo;Report Data Source&rdquo; if creating from a report document library. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/newdatasource.png" alt="NewDataSource"> Fill in the following details: • Name • Data Source Type: If source is SQL server database, select ‘Microsoft SQL Server’ Connection String: Example of connection string is Data Source=<!-- raw HTML omitted -->;Initial Catalog=<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Replace the SERVERNAME tag with the database server name instance and DATABASENAME tag with the database name in the server. The final connection string will look like “Data Source=SUPPORTSQL2K8R2;Initial Catalog=VM470_PWA_Reporting” 3. Click ‘Test Connection’. If the connection to the data source is successful, the message ‘Connection created successfully’ appears below the ‘Test Connection’ button. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/db_conn_success.png" alt="DB_Conn_Success"> 4. Click ‘Apply’ to save the data source.</p>
<h2 id="22-data-set">2.2 Data Set</h2>
<h3 id="221-create-shared-data-set">2.2.1 Create Shared Data Set</h3>
<p>A data set is a collection of related data records from a repository of data. 1. In your Web browser, type the URL for your report server in the address bar. By default, the URL is http://servername/reports. 2. Click ‘Report Builder’  (Please note if it is the first time you are trying to access report builder, it might prompt to download report builder) if using native reporting server else click on &ldquo;New Document&rdquo;&gt;&ldquo;Report Builder Report&rdquo; if accessing from a report document library. 3. Click ‘New Dataset’. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/newdataset.png" alt="NewDataset"> 4. Click ‘Browse other data sources…’. The ‘Select Data Source’ open dialog is displayed. Navigate to the appropriate data sources folder and select a data source. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/browsefordataconn.png" alt="BrowseForDataConn"> 5. Click on ‘Create’ Button. The ‘Enter Data Source Credentials’ dialog appears. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/credentialsfordataconn.png" alt="CredentialsForDataConn"> 6. Enter the Data Source Credentials and click on ‘OK’. The following window appears to allow creation of the dataset. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/querydesigner.png" alt="QueryDesigner"> The database view is displayed on the left panel. Four folders are available: • Tables Tables are physical storage of the data. In the PWA Reporting Database, some of the tables are • MSP_EpmProject • MSP_EpmTask • MSP_EpmResource • Views A view is a representation of the data from the tables. PWA provides out of the box views to facilitate reporting. A view looks like a table but does not store the data, only definition. Common views are • MSP_EpmProject_UserView • MSP_EpmResource_UserView • MSP_EpmTask_UserView • Stored Procedures A stored procedure can be used to perform tasks within the database, whether it is to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT. It can accept parameters, hence the preferred method of manipulating and returning data. A stored procedure is stored and cached by SQL Server’s optimizer and thus making it faster than an ad hoc query. • Table-valued Functions Functions are preferential over stored procedures because they can easily be used in JOINs and regular SELECTs. Compared to a view, it can be parameterised. 7. Tables, views, stored procedures and functions can be used to create a dataset. If you want to create a dataset to retrieve a list of tasks, expand the Tables folder from the database view panel and select the Tables ‘MSP_EpmProject’ and ‘MSP_EpmTask’. 8. Click on ‘Run Query’. Data from the two tables are displayed. 9. To filter the data returned, add filters to the dataset. In the ‘Applied filters’ section, click on the ‘Add Filter’ icon. A new row appears under the ‘Applied filters’ section. • Select ‘TaskIsMilestone’ from the available fields for Field name column. • Select ‘is’ in the Operator column • Enter ‘True’ in the Value column The filter created forces the dataset to return only tasks set as milestone. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/addfiltertodataset.png" alt="AddFilterToDataSet"> A parameter can be created using the same principle as the filter except the Parameter column is checked. In the above screenshot, ProjectUID is defined as a parameter which has to be passed through to the dataset before it is executed. 10. Click on ‘Edit as Text’ to view the SQL generated. <code>SELECT MSP_EpmProject.ProjectUID AS [MSP_EpmProject ProjectUID] ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectName ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectAuthorName ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectOwnerResourceUID ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectManagerName ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectType ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectStartDate ,MSP_EpmProject.ProjectFinishDate ---------------------------- ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskUID ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskParentUID ,MSP_EpmTask.ProjectUID AS [MSP_EpmTask ProjectUID] ,MSP_EpmTask.FixedCostAssignmentUID ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskName ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskIsExternal ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskIsRecurring ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskCostVariance ,MSP_EpmTask.TaskIsActive ---------------------------- FROM MSP_EpmProject INNER JOIN MSP_EpmTask ON MSP_EpmProject.ProjectUID = MSP_EpmTask.ProjectUID WHERE MSP_EpmTask.TaskIsMilestone = N'True' AND MSP_EpmProject.ProjectUID IN (@ProjectUID)</code> Please note the SQL shown above is not a complete script. The dashes represent other fields not specified above. An inner join between tables MSP_EpmProject and MSP_EPMTask has been created using ProjectUID as the relationship linking the tables together. The filters have created the two criteria under the WHERE clause.</p>
<h2 id="23-report">2.3 Report</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="231-create-report">2.3.1 Create Report</h3>
<p>1. In your Web browser, type the URL for your report server in the address bar. By default, the URL is http://servername/reports. 2. Click ‘Report Builder’ (Please note if it is the first time you are trying to access report builder, it might prompt to download report builder) if using native reporting server else click on &ldquo;New Document&rdquo;&gt;&ldquo;Report Builder Report&rdquo; if accessing from a report document library. 3. Click ‘Blank Report’. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/newreportbuilder.png" alt="NewReportBuilder"> The default Report Builder interface has: • The report data pane on the left which provides a single place for accessing the built-in fields, report parameters, images, and data fields. The data fields will appear after queries are defined. • The centre region is the report designer. Controls such as text box or tablix/matrix can be inserted. • Row Groups and Column Groups allow to setup groupings by dragging and dropping columns onto this area. <img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/blankreport.png" alt="BlankReport"></p>
