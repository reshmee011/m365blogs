      <description>CRM Dynamics data can be exported using the data migration tool by first generating the data schema file and using the later to export selected entities and fields. The same data migration tool can be used to import data into other environments. However it is still a manual process. I have written a script using Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell module in PowerShell to automate the data import. The zip generated by the export needs to be unzipped so that the path of the files can be passed to the method called to import the data.</description>

this is a good solution, however i&amp;rsquo;ll add more to it. If you want to find out exactly what the error is. Logon to machine which has sql server instance for the CRM. Check event viewer and see the errors for MSCRMReporting and it will tell you what the error is. In this case it is the version incompatibility.</description>

      <description>When I was trying to upload a SSRS report to replace an existing report to CRM Dynamics 2015 solution, I got the error Error Uploading Report An error occurred while trying to add the report to Microsoft Dynamics CRM. The error message does not say much. I decided to use Visual Studio 2015 to edit the CRM report which has caused the issue. I compared the code behind of the previous report and new report and found that there are new XML elements in the report generated by visual studio 2015 (SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2015).</description>

      <description>TheGet-CrmConnection method can be used to return connection to a CRM instance. The syntax to call the method is``` Parameter Set: OnLine Get-CrmConnection [-OnLineType] [[-Credential] ] [-DeploymentRegion] [[-ProfileName] ] -OrganizationName [ ]
Parameter Set: OnPrem Get-CrmConnection [-ServerUrl] [[-Credential] ] [-OrganizationName] [[-HomeRealmUrl] ] [[-ProfileName] ] [ ]
Parameter Set: UIOnly Get-CrmConnection [[-InteractiveMode]] [ ] I wanted to get the crm connection with the current user&#39;s credentials without any prompts.

      <description>I had a requirement to add contacts where the [Account Type] is &amp;ldquo;Lawyer&amp;rdquo; to entity &amp;ldquo;Case&amp;rdquo;. I created a relationship N:N between contacts and cases. Unfortunately the filter for N-N Add Existing button on a sub grid stopped working on from version CRM 2013. It does not work on CRM 2015 on Premises as well. I stumbled upon the blog Filter N:N Add Existing Lookup Dynamics CRM 2013 how to resolve the issue using the CRM function** LookupObjectsWithCallback.</description>

      <description>Recently while trying to deploy a CRM package into system test environment using the import-crmpackage command via PowerShell, time-out was occurring despite doubling the RAM memory as well as removing a lot of checkpoints from the machine. On the DEV environment, the deployment was taking around 20 mins. The DEV machine has more resources allocated explaining why the time-out was not spotted. To resolve the timeout issue, the lengthy instructions from Microsoft Knowledge Base Article can be followed.</description>
