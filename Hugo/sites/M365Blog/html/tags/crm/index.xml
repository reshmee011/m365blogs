      <description>I have set up custom duplicate rule detection on some entities&amp;rsquo; fields on a DEV CRM 2015 instance. I needed to export the settings to be able to import into other environments. I used the link Export Duplicate Detection Rules from one organization and import to another organization in CRM 2013 to export the rules. However the CRMDataMigrationUtility.exe SDK tool exports only unpublished duplicate detection rules which I had to do to be able to export the settings.</description>
