this is a good solution, however i&amp;rsquo;ll add more to it. If you want to find out exactly what the error is. Logon to machine which has sql server instance for the CRM. Check event viewer and see the errors for MSCRMReporting and it will tell you what the error is. In this case it is the version incompatibility.</description>

      <description>When I was trying to upload a SSRS report to replace an existing report to CRM Dynamics 2015 solution, I got the error Error Uploading Report An error occurred while trying to add the report to Microsoft Dynamics CRM. The error message does not say much. I decided to use Visual Studio 2015 to edit the CRM report which has caused the issue. IÂ compared the code behind of the previous report and new report and found that there are new XML elements in the report generated by visual studio 2015 (SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2015).</description>
