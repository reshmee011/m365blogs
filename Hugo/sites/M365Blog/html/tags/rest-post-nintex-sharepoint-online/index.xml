@Dub do you found the solution ?? i have the same problem
Hello Reshmee, Great tutorial! I could confirm that the content type has to be text/xml (as described above). But when I try to create the Group. I got the following error message: &amp;ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource&amp;rdquo;
Hi, has anyone found a solution to this Access denied error?</description>

      <description>Nintex Workflow has actions &amp;ldquo;Web Request&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Call HTTP Web Service&amp;rdquo; which can be used to make calls to the REST API of SharePoint Online/2013 to automate creation of SharePoint groups in a site collection. Add the following steps to the workflow
Create a Text variable GroupName and Use &amp;ldquo;Set Workflow Variable&amp;rdquo; to assign it to a value. Get request digest from targeted site collection. Please note that workflow app permissions need to amended to give site collection full control access.</description>
