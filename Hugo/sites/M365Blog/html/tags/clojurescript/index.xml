      <description>Clojurebridge experience as teaching assistant I have been learning Clojure/ClojureScript over the last three months in my spare time. I felt lucky to be asked to volunteer to be a teaching assistant for the ClojureBridge event held at USwitch on the 19th and 20th Feb 2016. I was feeling apprehensive initially due to my limited exposure to a functional programming language and most of the teachers and teaching assistants were either working full time with Clojure or had several years of playing with Clojure and were using a Mac while I have used Windows laptop to play with Clojure.</description>

      <description>I needed a date picker to use in ClojureScript application to enter date of birth. I came across the pikaday which I tried to use but the date range was limited and could not find a solution to not limit the date range. The native HTML input control of type date can be generated in Reagent as follows [:p &amp;quot;Enter Date Of Birth&amp;quot;] ;;using input control of type date to allow a date to be picked [:input {:type &amp;quot;date&amp;quot; :on-change (fn [e] (swap!</description>

      <description>ClojureScript is a compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It is designed to emit JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of the Google Closure optimizing compiler. Why ClojureScript?
Allows to use functional programming. Uses Immutable data structures. (Immutable.js library is available to enable use of immutable data structures with JavaScript. Watch Christian Johansen&amp;rsquo;s talk on Immutable JavaScript) Uses Google Closure Compiler : advanced code compiling with dead code elimination core.</description>
