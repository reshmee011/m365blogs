      <description>The CreateAnonymousLink method creates an anonymous link with option either to read or edit. It is quite useful to share documents with external users. The drawback is that anyone with the link can view/edit the document shared without sign-in. The method &amp;ldquo;CreateAnonymousLink &amp;quot; accomplishes the same as &amp;ldquo;View Link - no sign-in required&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Edit Link -no sign-in required&amp;rdquo; from the UI. https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/1f08ae19491e5c094986dfdb55f29731 Once the link is generated, it can be sent by email to the relevant individuals.</description>
