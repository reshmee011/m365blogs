Thanks !! This was an awesome tip - and works in SharePoint Online. I have an "Events" list to clear out - and just add PUBLIC + PRIVATE. This technique worked great - thanks again. :-)

Awesome! AND timely! Two questions: Will this work against a Sharepoint Online doc library with more than 5000 items? Can this alter an existing choice value as well as adding a new one? Thx, Barry

Hi Barry It will work against a document library as well independent of number of items present. To update existing choice value, the method will have to be modified to find the old choice value and update it with new choice value. Thanks Reshmee
