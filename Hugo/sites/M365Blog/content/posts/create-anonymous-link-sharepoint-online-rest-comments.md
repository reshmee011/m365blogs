Hi this is very helpful, but can you help with the steps to execute this. Also a clear explanation of all the parameters used will really help a lot of people.

Hi. Do you know how can I create an anonymous link for a list item within a list. Your example works perfect with a document within a library but I need to share a list item information, for example /Lists/ListName/DispForm.aspx?ID=20 It is possible to share a list item from the UI but I'm not able to achieve the same thing with the Rest API. Thank you
