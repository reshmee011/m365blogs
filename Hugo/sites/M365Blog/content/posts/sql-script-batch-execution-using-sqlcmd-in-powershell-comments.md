Definitely you can without a manifest file. If you want the scripts to run in some order, you can append a numerical number to the script file. Let me know if you need a sample code.

This example is great. Really helped me understand a few more things about PowerShell. But is it possible to do the same thing without using a manifest file (i.e. execute every .sql file in a given folder)?
