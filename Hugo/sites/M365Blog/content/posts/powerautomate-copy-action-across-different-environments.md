# Power Automate copy actions across different environments

If an action is copied from a different environment, the action is not avaible from the `My Clipboard`, if not you are presented with the following message only.

{{< warning >}}
Save time and paste your most-used Flow code
snippets here.

Select the ellipsis menu on any trigger or action, then
choose Copy to my Clipboard.

Note: Pasted code clears each time you log out of Power
Automate.
{{< /warning >}}

Don't fret, the option is just to paste by pressing ctrl+v onto the empty clipboard and voila the action is there to be choose to add to the flow.
