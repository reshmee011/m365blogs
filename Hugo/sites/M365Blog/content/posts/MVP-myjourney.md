## Nomination process

I submitted my contributions early September



## Post Award

Yesterday morning, amid the rush of getting my little ones ready for school, an unexpected email landed in my inbox. Initially brushing it off as clever spam, I was stunned to realize it wasn't - it was the incredible news that I've joined the coveted hashtag#mvpbuzz family club. It's a dream I never allowed myself to entertain. Still reeling, I'm overwhelmed with emotion, gratitude, and a profound sense of humility upon receiving this honor. ðŸ™Œ 

A great start to the year 2024 indeed! It marks the beginning of a new chapter - a journey to understand firsthand what it truly means to be part of this esteemed community while continuing my contributions to help others.

I owe a debt of gratitude to several remarkable individuals. First and foremost, a heartfelt thank you to ðŸ‘‘Luise Freese for the nomination and unparalleled mentorship. I'm deeply grateful to Adam WÃ³jcik and Markus Moeller for their belief in me, as well as the numerous others who've lent their unwavering support and encouragement along this journey. A big shout-out to Microsoft: Claire Smyth, Vesa Juvonen, and Waldek Mastykarz and my employer Pension Protection Fund for making this incredible moment possible. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
On the 9th January , the least expected news when I thought it would be in February
Not sure what happened for my account to be disabled and how I missed the invite to the tenant to enable me to setup MFA, do you know the default time of inactivity for guest account to be disabled in the tenant?  Fingers crossed it will be sorted soon.
