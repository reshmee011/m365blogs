It's been nearly 9 years at PPF starting as SharePoint .Net developer. I had the opportunity to attend CRM Dynamics 2015 and supported MARVIN for 4 years working on fixes and implementing features. 
I spent a lot of time in the office and I will miss the PPF family and people. I have built many memories some once in a lifetime memories like attending the Buckingham Garden Party. 
I had the chance to help with the move of EDRMS and intranet to SharePoint Online and implementing features. 

I would like to say thank you to everyone for continuous support, recognition.

Life is too short to live with regrets and need to challenge ourselves from our comfort zone, what we find familiar to try something else and grow
