failedToCreateProjectFromScratchAsEnvironmentMissingFeatures

> Running command: yo @microsoft/sharepoint  --solution-name "reactnewsticker" --component-type webpart --component-name "reactnewsticker" --framework react --skip-install 
Error @microsoft/sharepoint --solution-name reactnewsticker --component-type webpart --component-name reactnewsticker --framework react --skip-install 

Current environment doesn't provides some necessary feature this generator needs.
