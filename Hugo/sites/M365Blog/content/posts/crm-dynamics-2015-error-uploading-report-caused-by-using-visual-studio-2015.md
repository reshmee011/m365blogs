When I was trying to upload a SSRS report to replace an existing report to CRM Dynamics 2015 solution, I got the error **Error Uploading Report** An error occurred while trying to add the report to Microsoft Dynamics CRM. ![erroruploadingreport](https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/erroruploadingreport.png) The error message does not say much. I decided to use Visual Studio 2015 to edit the CRM report which has caused the issue. IÂ compared the code behind of the previous report and new report and found that there are new XML elements in the report generated by visual studio 2015 (SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2015). For example, "reportsections" xml tag has been inserted.```
 <ReportSections>
 <ReportSection>
 <Body>
 <ReportItems>
 <Tablix Name="Tablix4">
 <TablixBody>
 <TablixColumns>
 <TablixColumn>
 <Width>3in</Width>
 </TablixColumn>
 <TablixColumn>
 <Width>1.5in</Width>
 </TablixColumn>
 <TablixColumn>
 <Width>1.5in</Width>
 </TablixColumn>
 <TablixColumn>
 <Width>1.5in</Width>
 </TablixColumn>
 <TablixColumn>
 <Width>2.0455in</Width>
 </TablixColumn>
 </TablixColumns>
 <TablixRows>
 <TablixRow>
```The only option for me was to rework the report in Visual Studio 2013 (SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2013) before uploading the report to CRM dynamics solution successfully.
