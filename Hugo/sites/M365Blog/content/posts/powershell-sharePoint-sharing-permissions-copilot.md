# Empowering Secure Collaboration: Configuring SharePoint Sharing Tenant and Site Settings with PowerShell to prevent oversharing

Sharing lies at the heart of collaboration within SharePoint, facilitating seamless communication and teamwork. However, effective management of sharing settings is crucial to maintain data security and prevent unintended exposure. This is particularly important in light of tools like Copilot for M365, which help identify and mitigate instances of oversharing that can compromise data security. Let's explore how PowerShell can empower you to configure some sharing settings effectively at both the tenant and site levels.

An extract from [Announcing SharePoint advanced management innovations for the AI and Copilot era](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-premium-blog/announcing-sharepoint-advanced-management-innovations-for-the-ai/ba-p/4126366?WT.mc_id=5005104&ck_subscriber_id=2673998245)

```powershell
With Copilot and AI, security has become a concern. Not because Copilot allows people to access anything more than they could previously; it just allows them to find information they have access to faster. A term used sometimes in SharePoint is "Security by obscurity"; hide stuff and hope people don't find it. That doesn't work as well anymore with Copilot. It surfaces data more broadly and quickly. 
```

In this article, we'll delve into how PowerShell can empower SharePoint administrators to configure sharing settings proactively at both the tenant and site levels. By leveraging PowerShell scripts, you can streamline the process of enforcing security measures to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate the risk of oversharing.

Let's explore the key strategies and PowerShell commands you can implement to reinforce the security of your SharePoint environment, ensuring that collaboration remains productive while minimizing the potential for data breaches.

## Tenant Level Sharing Settings

### SharingCapability

This setting governs the sharing capability for the entire tenant, allowing you to control external user sharing and guest link sharing. 

The valid values are:

ExternalUserAndGuestSharing (default) - External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both enabled: Anyone - users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in

Disabled - External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both disabled - Only people in your organization - no external sharing allowed

ExternalUserSharingOnly - External user sharing (share by email) is enabled, but guest link sharing is disabled. New and existing guests - guests must sign in or provide a verification code

ExistingExternalUserSharingOnly - Existing guests only - only guests already in your organization's directory

![SharingCapability](../images/powershell-sharePoint-sharing-permissions-copilot/SharingCapability.png)

### ShowAllUsersClaim

Determines whether the "All Users" claim group is displayed in the People Picker.

The valid values are: 
True(default) - "All users" is displayed in People Picker. When users share an item with "All Users (x)" it is accessible to all organization members in the tenant that used NTLM to authentication with SharePoint.
False - "All users" claim is not visible in People Picker.

The All Users group is equivalent to the Everyone claim, and shows as Everyone. 

![SharingOptions](../images/powershell-sharePoint-sharing-permissions-copilot/SharingOptions.png)

### ShowEveryoneClaim

Determines whether the "Everyone" claim group is displayed in the People Picker.

The valid values are: 
True(default) - The "Everyone" is displayed in People Picker. When users share an item with "Everyone", it is accessible to all authenticated users including any active external users
False - The "Everyone" claim is not visible in People Picker. It is the default for new tenants.

### ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim

Enables or disables the display of the "Everyone except external users" claim in the People Picker. When users share an item with "Everyone except external users", it is accessible to all organisation members except external users in the tenant's Azure Active Directory.

The valid values are:
True(default) - The Everyone except external users is displayed in People Picker.
False - The Everyone except external users claim is not visible in People Picker.

### MySiteSharingCapability

Configures sharing capability for mysite (onedrive), offering options similar to those for the overall tenant.

The valid values are:

ExternalUserAndGuestSharing (default) - External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both enabled: Anyone - users can share files and folders using links that don't require sign-in

Disabled - External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both disabled - Only people in your organization - no external sharing allowed

ExternalUserSharingOnly - External user sharing (share by email) is enabled, but guest link sharing is disabled. New and existing guests - guests must sign in or provide a verification code

ExistingExternalUserSharingOnly - Existing guests only - only guests already in your organization's directory

### ProvisionSharedWithEveryoneFolder

Automatically creates a "Shared with Everyone" folder in users' OneDrive document libraries, enhancing collaboration.

### EnableGuestSignInAcceleration

Enables auto-acceleration on sites that have external sharing enabled. 

If the SignInAcceleration Domain is not set , the setting cannot be changed and you will be presented with message

`Set-SPOTenant : This setting cannot be changed until you set the SignInAcceleration Domain.`

Run the command to enable auto-acceleration on sites that aren't shared externally
```
Set-SPOTenant -SignInAccelerationDomain "contoso.com"
```

If set to $true, you will be prompted with the message

`Make sure that your federated sign-in supports guest users. If it doesn't, your guest users will no longer be able to sign in after you set EnableGuestSignlnAcceleration to $true.`

[Enable auto-acceleration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/enable-auto-acceleration??wt.mc_id=MVP_308367)

### RequireAnonymousLinksExpireInDays

Values can be set to None, Direct, Internal or AnonymousAccess

If set to AnonymousAccess you may get the following warning message to set `SharingCapability` to `ExternalUserAndGuestSharing`.

**WARNING**: `Anonymous access links arenâ€™t enabled for your organization. You must first enable them by running the command "Set-PnPTenant -SharingCapability ExternalUserAndGuestSharing" before you can set the DefaultSharingLinkType parameter to AnonymousAccess. We will not set the value in this case.`


### PreventExternalUsersFromResharing

Allows or denies external users from resharing.

## Site Level Settings

Sharing settings can be set at the site level to provide more granular control.

### DisableCompanyWideSharingLinks

Disables People in your organization links. For more information, see People in your organization sharing links. Possible values

Disabled: If disabled, users sharing files in the site may need to use Specific people links, which can be shared with a maximum of 50 people.
NotDisabled: Users can choose option `People in <tenantName>` while sharing
