Hi there, can you provide some advice here. When I copy-paste your code in the Script Editor, I don't get buttons but Text fields instead. The javascript code also doesn't work for me. Any troubleshooting ideas?

Hi Lilia Thanks very much for trying my code. The single and double quotes got messed up. I have replaced the code with a link to github https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/b36395eb08654baa4a8e6e3c9f83e6f4

This code is great have been looking for something like this for a while. I am now using the selected items part and need to export to excel or csv. Any ideas on that. I have looked through the web nothing really being done in java script. All trusted solutions.

How would you update a drop-down field? – In my work area needing to route these items to 3 levels (review, validate and then approve) ---when selecting the approve button how can this Javascript change my drop-down field? (steps please –new with Java....)

This is exactly the solution I am looking for however, it is not posting back to the SharePoint Online list. Is there something different that needs to happen?
