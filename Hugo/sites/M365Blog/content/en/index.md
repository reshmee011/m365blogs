Welcome to my blog post. 

I am Reshmee Auckloo. I am a SharePoint Developer at Pension Protection Fund and a Microsoft MVP in M365 Development since January 2024. 

I started my career journey as a .Net developer before transitioning to SharePoint and Project Server in 2011. In 2021, I began my cloud journey with SharePoint Online and M365, discovering a vast array of extensions available.
Throughout my journey, I have found community resources to be invaluable, inspiring me to contribute back. I have actively enriched the PnP repositories since 2021, focusing on PnP Sample Scripts, PnP PowerShell, CLI for M365, and related repositories. I believe in "sharing is caring" and empowering others within the tech community.

Beyond work and community engagements, I cherish spending quality time with my two daughters, family, and friends.
