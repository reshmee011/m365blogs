I have seen the issues several times where date/time parameters used to filter date in SSRS reports are switched to en-US despite the language of the reports is set to en-GB. If dates like 24/12/2015 or 15/12/2015 are picked , the report fails to load due to invalid date format. I came across the article that describes a fix. http://www.tachytelic.net/2013/01/changing-the-format-of-date-parameters-on-a-sql-server-2012-reporting-services-report-that-is-sharepoint-integrated/ Hard code the UICulture value in RSViewerPage.aspx, found in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\15\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\ReportServer The modified code will look like: <%@ Page language="C#" Codebehind="RSViewerPage.aspx.cs" AutoEventWireup="false" Inherits="Microsoft.ReportingServices.SharePoint.UI.RSViewerPage,Microsoft.ReportingServices.SharePoint.UI.ServerPages,Version=11.0.0.0,Culture=neutral,PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91" UICulture="en-GB" %> Changing the UICulture causes lost the formatting of the sidebar on report viewer because the style folder is missing. EN-GB has a locale ID of 2057, previously the page source was referring to 1033 which is “English (United States)”. The Styles subfolder which contains styles for each locale is on path. C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\14\\TEMPLATE\\LAYOUTS\\ReportServer\\styles Create a new folder 2057 and copy all contents of 1033 into 2057. Hard coding values is not recommended but has worked for the clients where I have implemented same change. The Cumulative update 5 for SQL Server 2012 might fix the issue but did not manage to get it working. https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/2764343
