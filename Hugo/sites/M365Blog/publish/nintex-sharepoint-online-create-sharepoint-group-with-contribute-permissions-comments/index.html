@Dub do you found the solution ?? i have the same problem
Hello Reshmee, Great tutorial! I could confirm that the content type has to be text/xml (as described above). But when I try to create the Group. I got the following error message: &ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource&rdquo;
Hi, has anyone found a solution to this Access denied error?"><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2016-05-03T14:53:03+00:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2016-05-03T14:53:03+00:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="372"><meta itemprop=keywords content="Nintex,REST,REST POST Nintex SharePoint Online,SharePoint,SharePoint 2013,SharePoint Online,"><meta property="og:title" content="Nintex SharePoint Online Create SharePoint Group with Contribute permissions"><meta property="og:description" content="Mixons - Nov 1, 2016

The permissions of the workflow app need to be configured. I have described it at the beginning of another post <a href=https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service/>https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service/</a> In summary, workflow needs to be enabled to use app permissions and be given full control from appinv.aspx page. Follow the instructions from msdn link below. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj822159(v=office.15).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj822159(v=office.15).aspx</a></p><p>Hello I am following your steps but in the step 2 ◾Add “Query XML” action I get the following error: XML content is invalid. 6/28/2016 6:55 AM Comment {&ldquo;d&rdquo;:{&ldquo;GetContextWebInformation&rdquo;:{"__metadata":{&ldquo;type&rdquo;:&ldquo;SP.ContextWebInformation&rdquo;},&ldquo;FormDigestTimeoutSeconds&rdquo;:1800,&ldquo;FormDigestValue&rdquo;:&ldquo;0xF62EFE5E7 6/28/2016 6:56 AM Comment XML content is invalid.

You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource.&rdquo; on the create group HTTP call. All actions and the workflow itself are running with site collection admin credentials. Stuck on next steps&mldr;&mldr;great tutorial thus far though!</p><p>The effective permissions of the workflow are an intersection of user permissions and the app permissions similar to SharePoint apps. If the user running the workflow does not have permissions to create group then access denied error will be thrown.</p><p>Hi, the user is set up as site collection admin. Also, the workflow actions are running within app step with elevated privileges.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2023 <a href=https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink>Ink</a> theme on <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
