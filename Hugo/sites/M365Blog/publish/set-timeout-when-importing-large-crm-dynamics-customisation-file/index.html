On the DEV environment, the deployment was taking around 20 mins. The DEV machine has more resources allocated explaining why the time-out was not spotted. To resolve the timeout issue, the lengthy instructions from <a href=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/918609>Microsoft Knowledge Base Article</a> can be followed. A simpler solution would be to set the timeout property during import. From the <a href=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn756301.aspx>Import-CrmPackage documentation</a> the -timeout property is of type string and meant for internal purpose only. The format of data the -timeout property is not evident. We tried passing &ldquo;3600&rdquo; which would be 1 hour if the property was expecting seconds, however the import-crmpackage failed because of invalid data. <code>Import-CrmPackage -CrmConnection $CRMConn -PackageDirectory "$($filePath)" -PackageName CRMPackageDeploymentTest.dll -Verbose -Timeout "3600"; Import-</code> Using a .Net Reflector tool, we managed to find out the format the timeout property needs to be passed is a timespan object of format &ldquo;g&rdquo;. By default the timeout is set to 30 mins. <code>Import-CrmPackage -CrmConnection $CRMConn -PackageDirectory "$($filePath)" -PackageName CRMPackageDeploymentTest.dll -Verbose -Timeout "1:00:00";</code> The deployment process took 34 mins to finish and timeout error was not thrown.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2023 <a href=https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink>Ink</a> theme on <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
