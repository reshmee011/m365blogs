However if I switch to classic view I get the message</p><p>&ldquo;This view cannot be displayed because it exceeds the list view threshold (5000 items) enforced by the administrator.<br>To view items, try selecting another view or creating a new view. If you do not have sufficient permissions to create views for this list, ask your administrator to modify the view so that it conforms to the list view threshold.&rdquo;</p><p>Fortunately &ldquo;exit the classic view&rdquo; made the error disappear. Views exceeding the list view threshold of 5000 k work in the modern experience. As you filter and sort by a column , indexes are automatically created in the list indexed columns. In the screenshot below the Severity column has been added automatically when I was sorting the library using the column.</p><p><a href=https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/automaticallyindexedcolumns.png><img src="https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/automaticallyindexedcolumns.png?w=960" alt></a></p><p>However automatic creation of indexes is limited to lists or libraries with less than 20 k items, otherwise you may encounter errors. In modern experience, automatic indexes are created with columns used for filtering and sorting in saved views or when sorting.</p><p>Also list view threshold error can happen if filtering or sorting by columns of type lookup, people and managed metadata.</p><p>Source: <a href=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-large-lists-and-libraries-b8588dae-9387-48c2-9248-c24122f07c59>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/manage-large-lists-and-libraries-b8588dae-9387-48c2-9248-c24122f07c59</a></p><p>&ldquo;<strong>Note:</strong> Displaying 12 or more columns of the following types can cause a list view threshold error: people, lookup, and managed metadata.
