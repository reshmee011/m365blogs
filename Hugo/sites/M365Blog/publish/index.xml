@Timothy: Thanks for the clarification. I have updated the post.
You might consider these conditional macros, too: when-let, cond-&amp;gt;, cond-&amp;raquo; and maybe some-&amp;gt;
Alsobe aware that case tests for identity, not for equality.
Hi Timothy Thanks for your feedback. I agree that empty collections are truthy as in the example you provided. However empty sequences are falsey (if (seq []):truthy :falsey); ;;=&amp;gt; falsey
(seq []) is falsey because it converts an empty sequence (which is truthy) to nil (which is falsey).</description></item><item><title>Clojure If, cond, case</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/clojure-if-cond-case/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 21:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/clojure-if-cond-case/</guid><description>Clojure has lots of operators for dealing with conditional statements: if, cond, condp, case and when.
