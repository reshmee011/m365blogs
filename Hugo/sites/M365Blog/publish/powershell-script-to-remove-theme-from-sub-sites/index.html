I used the composed look option to reset the theme to a default without background image on the main site collection URL. Unfortunately sub sites were still displaying the background image. I tried setting the theme of the Sub Site using function <a href=http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/78872/how-do-you-apply-a-theme-with-powershell-in-2013>ApplyTo</a> or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/jj251358(v=office.15).aspx">ApplyTheme</a> without luck. I finally decided to remove theme from the sub sites which works the same way as resetting to default. The PowerShell script to remove theme from sub sites is $url = &ldquo;<a href=http://inm.test/local%22>http://inm.test/local"</a> $site = Get-SPSite -Identity $url foreach ($web in $site.AllWebs) {   Write-Host &ldquo;Web Title: " $web.Title   $web.allowunsafeupdates = $true   $theme = [Microsoft.SharePoint.Utilities.ThmxTheme]::RemoveThemeFromWeb($web,$false)   $web.Update()   $web.allowunsafeupdates = $false   $web.Dispose() } $site.Dispose(); The background image on all sub sites is cleared.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2023 <a href=https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink>Ink</a> theme on <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
