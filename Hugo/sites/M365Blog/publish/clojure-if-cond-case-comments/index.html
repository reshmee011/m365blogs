@Timothy: Thanks for the clarification. I have updated the post.
You might consider these conditional macros, too: when-let, cond->, cond-&#187; and maybe some->
Alsobe aware that case tests for identity, not for equality.
Hi Timothy Thanks for your feedback. I agree that empty collections are truthy as in the example you provided. However empty sequences are falsey (if (seq []):truthy :falsey); ;;=> falsey
(seq []) is falsey because it converts an empty sequence (which is truthy) to nil (which is falsey)."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.111.3"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><link href=/clojure-if-cond-case-comments/index.xml rel=alternate type=application/rss+xml title="Reshmee blog"><link href=/clojure-if-cond-case-comments/index.xml rel=feed type=application/rss+xml title="Reshmee blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Clojure If, cond, case"><meta property="og:description" content="reshmee011 - Dec 1, 2015

So it&rsquo;s not correct to say that an empty sequence is falsey, because by themselves (be they an empty set, hashmap, vector or list), they are truthy.
