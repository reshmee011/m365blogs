Do you know how can I create an anonymous link for a list item within a list. Your example works perfect with a document within a library but I need to share a list item information, for example /Lists/ListName/DispForm.aspx?ID=20 It is possible to share a list item from the UI but I&rsquo;m not able to achieve the same thing with the Rest API. Thank you</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2023 <a href=https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink>Ink</a> theme on <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
