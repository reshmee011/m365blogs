I tried the PnP command SetSPOTheme as follows on SharePoint 2013 On Premises instance. Set-SPOTheme -ColorPaletteUrl $PathThemeColor -FontSchemeUrl $PathThemeFont Unfortunately I was getting message &amp;lsquo;Field or property &amp;ldquo;AlternateCssUrl&amp;rdquo; does not exist.&amp;rsquo; The error is due not having latest patch installed. Unfortunately the latest SharePoint CU can&amp;rsquo;t be installed as we have heavily customised legacy applications migrated from SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010 running in compatibility mode.</description></item></channel></rss>
