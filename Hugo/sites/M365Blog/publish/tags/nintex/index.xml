However if external users are given permissions using this step, it fails with message &amp;ldquo;failed to resolve user &amp;ldquo;. The issue with Office 365 update item permissions is that it does not allow updating permissions for external users.
With the SharePoint 2016 Remote API Sharing with external users can be achieved using method UpdateDocumentSharingInfo from class SPDocumentSharingManager which fortunately can be called using REST.</description></item><item><title>Nintex SharePoint Online Create SharePoint Group with Contribute permissions</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions-comments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 14:53:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions-comments/</guid><description>Mixons - Nov 1, 2016
@Dub do you found the solution ?? i have the same problem
Hello Reshmee, Great tutorial! I could confirm that the content type has to be text/xml (as described above). But when I try to create the Group. I got the following error message: &amp;ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource&amp;rdquo;
Hi, has anyone found a solution to this Access denied error?</description></item><item><title>Nintex SharePoint Online Create SharePoint Group with Contribute permissions</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 14:53:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions/</guid><description>Nintex Workflow has actions &amp;ldquo;Web Request&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Call HTTP Web Service&amp;rdquo; which can be used to make calls to the REST API of SharePoint Online/2013 to automate creation of SharePoint groups in a site collection. Add the following steps to the workflow
Create a Text variable GroupName and Use &amp;ldquo;Set Workflow Variable&amp;rdquo; to assign it to a value. Get request digest from targeted site collection. Please note that workflow app permissions need to amended to give site collection full control access.</description></item><item><title>Nintex DocSign Enable Multiple Recipients</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-docsign-multiple-recipients-comments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 10:04:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-docsign-multiple-recipients-comments/</guid><description>Nintex DocSign Enable Multiple Recipients | reshmeeauckloo - Apr 6, 2016

Nintex provides the DocuSign send document action that integrates DocuSign service. A trial account for PROD can be created but the trial limit is 3 documents. For development or evaluation purposes, a free developer account can be created on DocuSign site. Follow the instructions from The Quick Quide to Doc Sign to configure your dev account. Part of the process is to create an integrator key which is needed to call DocuSign REST API.</description></item><item><title>Nintex Workflow SharePoint Online Create Sub Site using Call HTTP Web Service Action</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service-comments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2015 22:36:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-workflow-sharepoint-online-create-sub-site-http-web-service-comments/</guid><description>Katie - Jun 4, 2017
