The workflow was exported to visio as a .vwi file. Unfortunately when the I tried to import the file using the &amp;ldquo;Import as visio&amp;rdquo; option from SharePoint Designer, the message was appearing &amp;ldquo;This workflow cannot be imported because it was created in SharePoint Designer for a different site, or the original workflow has been moved or deleted.&amp;rdquo; I stumbled upon the blog below how to fix the migration issue https://aniketahmed.</description></item></channel></rss>
