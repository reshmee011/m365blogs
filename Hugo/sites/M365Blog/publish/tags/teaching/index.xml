I felt lucky to be asked to volunteer to be a teaching assistant for the ClojureBridge event held at USwitch on the 19th and 20th Feb 2016. I was feeling apprehensive initially due to my limited exposure to a functional programming language and most of the teachers and teaching assistants were either working full time with Clojure or had several years of playing with Clojure and were using a Mac while I have used Windows laptop to play with Clojure.</description></item></channel></rss>
