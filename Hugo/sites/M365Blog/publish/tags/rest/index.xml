However if external users are given permissions using this step, it fails with message &amp;ldquo;failed to resolve user &amp;ldquo;. The issue with Office 365 update item permissions is that it does not allow updating permissions for external users.
With the SharePoint 2016 Remote API Sharing with external users can be achieved using method UpdateDocumentSharingInfo from class SPDocumentSharingManager which fortunately can be called using REST.</description></item><item><title>Rest Api Generate Guest Link SharePoint Online</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/create-anonymous-link-sharepoint-online-rest-comments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 17:36:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/create-anonymous-link-sharepoint-online-rest-comments/</guid><description>vamsim - Jun 3, 2017
Hi this is very helpful, but can you help with the steps to execute this. Also a clear explanation of all the parameters used will really help a lot of people.
what is the adequate permission one needs on the resource to create its anonymous link, I have logged in as read only user and i am getting access denied error while executing above script, can you explain this</description></item><item><title>Rest Api Generate Guest Link SharePoint Online</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/create-anonymous-link-sharepoint-online-rest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 17:36:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/create-anonymous-link-sharepoint-online-rest/</guid><description>The CreateAnonymousLink method creates an anonymous link with option either to read or edit. It is quite useful to share documents with external users. The drawback is that anyone with the link can view/edit the document shared without sign-in. The method &amp;ldquo;CreateAnonymousLink &amp;quot; accomplishes the same as &amp;ldquo;View Link - no sign-in required&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Edit Link -no sign-in required&amp;rdquo; from the UI. https://gist.github.com/reshmee011/1f08ae19491e5c094986dfdb55f29731 Once the link is generated, it can be sent by email to the relevant individuals.</description></item><item><title>Nintex SharePoint Online Create SharePoint Group with Contribute permissions</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions-comments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 14:53:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-sharepoint-online-create-sharepoint-group-with-contribute-permissions-comments/</guid><description>Mixons - Nov 1, 2016
@Dub do you found the solution ?? i have the same problem
Hello Reshmee, Great tutorial! I could confirm that the content type has to be text/xml (as described above). But when I try to create the Group. I got the following error message: &amp;ldquo;Access denied. You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource&amp;rdquo;

Add the following steps to the workflow
Create a Text variable GroupName and Use &amp;ldquo;Set Workflow Variable&amp;rdquo; to assign it to a value. Get request digest from targeted site collection. Please note that workflow app permissions need to amended to give site collection full control access.</description></item><item><title>Nintex DocSign Enable Multiple Recipients</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-docsign-multiple-recipients-comments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2016 10:04:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/nintex-docsign-multiple-recipients-comments/</guid><description>Nintex DocSign Enable Multiple Recipients | reshmeeauckloo - Apr 6, 2016

Nintex provides the DocuSign send document action that integrates DocuSign service. A trial account for PROD can be created but the trial limit is 3 documents. For development or evaluation purposes, a free developer account can be created on DocuSign site. Follow the instructions from The Quick Quide to Doc Sign to configure your dev account. Part of the process is to create an integrator key which is needed to call DocuSign REST API.</description></item><item><title>SharePoint REST Get all items __next</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/sharepoint-rest-get-all-items-__next/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 00:14:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/sharepoint-rest-get-all-items-__next/</guid><description>When a REST query is run against a SharePoint list, not all items are returned if it contains more than 100 items.
