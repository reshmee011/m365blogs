You may argue the easiest solution is a migration of the backup of database. Unfortunately it does not work well in environments where data in Live is classified as sensitive and are not allowed to be copied across into a dev / test machine where the security is not as strict as a live machine.</description></item><item><title>Import Configuration Data to CRM using Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/import-configuration-data-to-crm-using-microsoft-xrm-data-powershell-comments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 17:42:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/import-configuration-data-to-crm-using-microsoft-xrm-data-powershell-comments/</guid><description>nongtingtihurgcon - Feb 1, 2017

The same data migration tool can be used to import data into other environments. However it is still a manual process. I have written a script using Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell module in PowerShell to automate the data import. The zip generated by the export needs to be unzipped so that the path of the files can be passed to the method called to import the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
