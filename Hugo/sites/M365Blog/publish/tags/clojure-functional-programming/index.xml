I have heard a lot about functional programming languages like Clojure, F# and Scala. I decided to start learning Clojure. My first reaction after seeing a Clojure code was the syntax and layout which was unreadable to me. Clojure is a member of the Lisp family of languages. The use of parentheses is prominent. Below is some code that calculates factorial of a number in Clojure (defn fac &amp;quot;Returns factorial of n&amp;quot; [n] (if (= n 1) 1 (* n (fac (- n 1))))) Parentheses are used to structure lists and lists are building blocks of code.</description></item></channel></rss>
