I wanted to create Shared Custom properties on the term. However the JavaScript library on MSDN mentions only the method setLocalCustomProperty which creates or updates a local custom property. The SetCustomProperty is mentioned in MSDN to use in CSOM managed code to create or update shared custom property on a term. There is a lack of documentation how to use the method in JSOM.</description></item><item><title>Search Display Template js file not created when HTML file for Item_ThreeLines is created</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/search-display-template-js-file-not-created-when-html-file-for-item_threelines-is-created/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 23:41:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/search-display-template-js-file-not-created-when-html-file-for-item_threelines-is-created/</guid><description>On a SharePoint Online site collection where Publishing feature was initially turned on and subsequently turned off, js file was not automatically created/updated whenever a display template was created/edited. We wanted to have a search content web part with three lines instead of two lines. We created a new display template by following the steps below.
Navigate to Site Settings&amp;gt;Master Pages&amp;gt;Display Templates&amp;gt;Content Web Parts. Download the file Item_TwoLines.html Rename it to Item_ThreeLines.</description></item></channel></rss>
