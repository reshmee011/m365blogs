It is quick clunky specially when there are a lot of terms displayed. The requirement cropped up to display the managed metadata fields as drop downs. After googling for a while, stumbled on PnP sample Branding.JSLink solution which had an example how to achieve it. The solution is a no code sandboxed solution with different examples how to enrich fields.</description></item><item><title>Using PnP PowerShell to export and import Taxonomy</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/using-pnp-powershell-to-export-and-import-taxonomy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 20:43:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/using-pnp-powershell-to-export-and-import-taxonomy/</guid><description>PnP provides export taxonomy cmdlet which allows to export all term groups, term sets, terms and child terms to a file with one line of codeConnect-SPOnline -Url &amp;lt;siteurl&amp;gt; -CurrentCredentials Export-SPOTaxonomy -IncludeID -Path &amp;quot;C:\\temp\\Metadata\\terms.txt&amp;quot;PnP also provides an equivalent import taxonomy cmdlet to import all term groups, term sets, terms and child terms from a file with one line of codeConnect-SPOnline -Url &amp;lt;siteurl&amp;gt; -CurrentCredentials Import-SPOTaxonomy -Path &amp;quot;C:\\temp\\Metadata\\terms.txt&amp;quot;However if IncludeId switch parameter is used with the export, the import would fail if the October 2016 PnP PowerShell release is used.</description></item><item><title>Export Lists Schema to XML using CSOM and PnP</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/export-lists-schema-to-xml-using-csom-and-pnp-comments/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2016 09:36:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/export-lists-schema-to-xml-using-csom-and-pnp-comments/</guid><description>Create Lists Libraries from Schema as XML using CSOM | reshmeeauckloo - Oct 6, 2016

I will update the scripts at some point. Thanks for the comment.
The Imported TaxonomyFields seems not working, because of missing the second Taxonomy-Note-Field. I always get &amp;ldquo;The SPListItem being updated was not retrieved with all taxonomy fields&amp;rdquo; in Edit-Form of the imported Managed Metadata Columns. I have observed this. http://blog.bugrapostaci.com/2015/07/03/the-splistitem-being-updated-was-not-retrieved-with-all-taxonomy-fields/
Actually you must use the new PnP-PowerShell-Namespace in the PowerShell-Commands. Example: Connect-PnPOnline instead of Connect-SPOnline and so on&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Import/Export Columns and Content Types using PnP PowerShell</title><link>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/importexport-columns-and-content-types-sharepointpnp2016powershell-powershell/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2016 11:52:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reshmee.netlify.app/posts/importexport-columns-and-content-types-sharepointpnp2016powershell-powershell/</guid><description>It is useful to migrate Site Columns and Content Types from one Site Collection to another under the following scenarios maintaining the original GUIDS.
