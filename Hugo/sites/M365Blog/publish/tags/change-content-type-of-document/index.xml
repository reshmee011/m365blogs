As a first action, I identified all documents tagged with the content type to be removed and tried to update them with another content type. However some documentsÂ were still showing the old content type despite saving it with the new content type by updating the [Content Type] field. I tried removing the document and adding the document back to the document library, unfortunately it was still referencing the old content type.</description></item></channel></rss>
