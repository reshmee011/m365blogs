The Policy Settings on Picture property was disabled for some reason. <img src=https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/pictureurl-policysettingsettodisabled-1.png alt=pictureurl-policysettingsettodisabled-1> Disabled from <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Manage-user-profile-policies-in-SharePoint-admin-center-aa690e20-b52f-459a-b015-1620a884a7e7?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB">Manage user profile policies in SharePoint admin center </a>meant <em>The property or feature is visible only to the User Profile Service administrator. It does not appear in personalized sites or Web Parts, and it cannot be shared.</em> Also it meant the property was not visible when queried by REST API. After updating the policy settings to Optional, the pictureURL property for the user is being returned by the REST API query and showing up in SharePoint sites as well. <img src=https://reshmeeauckloo.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/pictureurl-policysettingsettooptional.png alt=pictureurl-policysettingsettooptional>```
