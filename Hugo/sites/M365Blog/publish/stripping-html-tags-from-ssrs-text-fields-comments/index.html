Appreciate the code. One question; Why is this required? Dim objRegExp AS NEW System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex( “”) and RETURN objRegExp.Replace(sInput, “”) Wouldn’t a simple return of sInput suffice? What am I missing here? Been racking my brain for hours. Thanks!
Hi TimK The HTML text I had to work with had encoded characters , for example &ldquo;&&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;&&rdquo;. The regex expression will remove all HTML tags but for my requirements, I wanted to preserve line breaks () , so I am handling these tags individually to be replaced with line feed (chr(10))."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2015-10-27T09:05:02+00:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2015-10-27T09:05:02+00:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="286"><meta itemprop=keywords content="SSRS,SSRS VB,VB,"><meta property="og:title" content="Stripping HTML tags from SSRS text fields"><meta property="og:description" content="TimK - Jun 4, 2017

Also had to transform to bulleted string , in the example above I am replacing "" with &ldquo;-&rdquo;. Depending on your requirements, thus you might have to amend the code further.

Using Visual Studio 2013 for report design.</p><p>Thanks for trying the code. Unfortunately the original code which has encoded characters got converted into plain text. I have updated the post with a link to gist. Can you please try the code again?</p><p>How can I use your expression along with truncating the text to 150 characters</p><p>Howdy, i read your blog from time to time and i own a similar one and i was just wondering if you get a lot of spam comments? If so how do you stop it, any plugin or anything you can recommend? I get so much lately it&rsquo;s driving me insane so any support is very much appreciated.</p><p>The first time I saw him my attention was drawn to the technique he had, the fluidity of his technique.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2023 <a href=https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink>Ink</a> theme on <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
