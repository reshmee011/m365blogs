Hi there, can you provide some advice here. When I copy-paste your code in the Script Editor, I don&rsquo;t get buttons but Text fields instead. The javascript code also doesn&rsquo;t work for me. Any troubleshooting ideas?

I am now using the selected items part and need to export to excel or csv. Any ideas on that. I have looked through the web nothing really being done in java script. All trusted solutions.</p><p>How would you update a drop-down field? – In my work area needing to route these items to 3 levels (review, validate and then approve) &mdash;when selecting the approve button how can this Javascript change my drop-down field? (steps please –new with Java&mldr;.)</p><p>This is exactly the solution I am looking for however, it is not posting back to the SharePoint Online list.
